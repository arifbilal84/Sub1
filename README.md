## Overview

\
In this project, a regression based model will be built from sctrach to predict the prices of houses using multivariate linear regression and Skicit learn package. 
The cost vs iteration graph will be monitored to monitor the training and valdation accuracy with each epoch. The matplotlib will be used for data visualization and two variants of gradient descent algorithm will be used to train the model,

* Stochastic gradient descent
* Batch gradient descent



## Environment

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Skicit Learn

## Datasets

The datasets contain features such as

* Location.
* Number of bedrooms.
* Number of bathrooms.
* Size of house.
* The price per square feet.
