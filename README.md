# Cars Classification

In this project, I am aiming to learn about CNN by explicitly training the deep neural convolutional neural network by identifying the images of BMW cars.

## Environment and dependencies

* Windows 10
* Google colab
* Python 3.8 (Kernel)
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Dataset

For training our deep convolutional neural network, I am going to use the Stanford cars classification data sets named as **BMW-10**.
* Reference: [Link to the dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) 
* Images count: 500 
* Input dimensions (Average): 600 x 400 x 3(RGB Channel)
* Number of classes: 2

\
Train set: 400 images
Cross-validation set: 50 images
Test set: 50 images

## Network Architecture

I will be training simple CNN having 4 hidden layers and a final output layer of sigmoid activation for binary classification of the dataset **BMW-10**.
\
In each hidden layer, I will be using Relu activation followed by MaxPooling to extract features from the images for training the model.

## Conclusions

This project will help me to improve my skills in python programming and will also allow me to explore deep learning in computer vision. I will be monitoring the accuracy and learning curves of this model so that the efficiency of the model can be improved.
